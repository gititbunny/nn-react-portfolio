            Well, I’m a multidisciplinary Junior Full-Stack Web Developer and
            Creative Technologist with a foundation in both software development
            and digital design. My journey into tech has been anything but
            traditional, but it’s been purposeful every step of the way.
            <br />
            <br />
            I began my academic journey in BSc Mathematical Sciences, focusing
            on Computer Science and Statistics, before pivoting toward more
            hands-on experience in digital creation. I transitioned into digital
            creation, building technical and creative fluency through
            internships, freelance work, and self-driven learning. I’ve
            developed and deployed responsive, user-focused web applications
            using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React.js, APIs, and modern
            tools like Git, Netlify, and VS Code, while leveraging my design
            background to craft clean, intuitive interfaces.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2024, I formalized my technical pivot and I've now in 2025 earned
            verified diplomas in full-stack and front-end development from Delac
            Foundation SheCodes. Since then, I’ve been and continue building
            real-world projects that merge design, logic, and storytelling, to
            create solutions that feel as good as they function.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether I’m coding interfaces, solving logic puzzles, or
            collaborating with a team, I care deeply about making things that
            are impactful, accessible, and human-centered. I’m currently seeking
            junior roles where I can grow, contribute meaningfully, and help
            shape thoughtful digital experiences.
